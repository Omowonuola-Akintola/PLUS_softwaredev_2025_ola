"""

This script will allow users compute change detection with radiometrically and corrected (RTC) SAR image. The change detection will be 
performed by stacking the RTC into a multiband image that allows user to display different times of the year at the same time, 
using the color bands to highlight areas that differ in radar backscatter.

The script accept SAR image in .tiff format and an Area of interest (aoi) data in geojson format.

The script requires rioxarray, numpy, matplotb

This file can be imported as a module and contain the following functions:

load_rtc_image
normalize_image

# PLUS_softwaredev_2025_ola
My name is Ola

The two files software_dev_v1 and software_dev_v2 were downloaded manually into my computer

The command as shown in the picture below was executed to create the first environment
(/Users/omowonuolaakintola/Documents/PLUS/Programming/repos/images/SC1.png)

This created a 'LibMambaUnsatisfiableError' since the my computer uses a MacOS but Windows packages are included in the .yml

The same command was used for the second environment and this successfully installed the packages in the v2.yml file

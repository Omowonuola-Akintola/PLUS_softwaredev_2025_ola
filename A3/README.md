This project demonstrates how to access Sentinel-1 SLC data through the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem using the STAC API and perform simple analysis using SARPY. It covers how to query and download SAR data programmatically, then read and inspect raw SAR from the .SAFE archive. Using basic thresholding on SAR magnitude values, the notebook extracts potential darker regions from the imagery. The goal is to show how cloud-based access and open-source tools can support local, lightweight SAR analysis workflows.
The data used is too large for github and can be found in this [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sZivsJv7qMlSfS8v_O99yDE9wEJklFCM?usp=sharing).
